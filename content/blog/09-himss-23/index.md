## Interoperability First

Heading to [HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society)](https://www.himss.org/) this year?

MayJuun is partnering with [Open City Labs](https://www.opencitylabs.com/home/) to demonstrate the entire closed-loop referral process, from person identification and screening assessment to creating and managing referrals.

We have also partnered with the [Interoperability Institute](https://interoperabilityinstitute.org/) to connect our questionnaire assessments application (Cuestionario) to their MELD open-source sandbox.
