## PRAPARE SURVEY -

This is a work in progress. The Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences ([PRAPARE]) survey was recreated in a Flutter environment using its [LOINC FHIR速 specification]. The app directly loads the FHIR速 spec (albeit with some basic modifications to the original FHIR速 JSON to more closely match the initial survey). It has basic validation in place for survey completion.
