## Cuestionario -

Cuestionario is an award-winning `white label application` that allows for customizable data capture and review of FHIR速 compliant assessments. `White label applications` may be themed and branded to suit your individual preferences and needs. Cuestionario serves as the patient-facing for New Jersey's Integrated Care for Kids ([HealthStory](https://njinck.org/)) and Connecticut's Integrated Care for Kids ([HealthJourney](https://cliffordbeersccc.org/ct-inck/)). It has been featured by the [Gravity Project](https://thegravityproject.net/transforming-assessments-and-referrals-for-nj-residents/) and was part of the solution that received the Grand Prize and Bonus Phase Prize by the Administration for Community Living's [Social Care Referrals Challenge](https://acl.gov/socialcarereferrals).

A full demonstration of the Cuestionario assessment app, as well as a companion cross-platform application to send/review results (Recetario), can be seen here:

### Cuestionario Features

- Customizable data capture app (questionnaire) that is FHIR速 compliant
- Designed for Medical questionnaires, but can be used for any subject
- Can be run on multiple devices or the web

#### Dynamic, Custom Questionnaires

We help create dynamic, custom questionnaires that include embedded language translations. We strictly follow the Structured Data Capture workflow, to which we have also published our use case as an [example for others](https://mayjuun.com/fhirfli/7-sdc-workflow-example/). For some projects, we have managed over 17 unique PlanDefinitions, 40 unique Questionnaires, 600+ FHIR速 Resources, and nearly 300,000 lines of JSON code, with content quickly accessible and editable via spreadsheet.

#### Multi-language Support

The application is built in Flutter, which supports 79 language translations by default. Notably, we have created solutions in custom languages not natively supported by Flutter (e.g. Haitian Creole).

#### Multiple Themes and Styles

As `white label applications`, both Cuestionario and Recetario may be themed and branded to suit your needs. All content, images, and logos can be modified quickly and effectively to match your suite of applications. This becomes less jarring for end users.
